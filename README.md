# Deep Learning - Vectorized and Non-vectorized Computing Comparison

:astonished: **Vectorized** computing `394x` faster than **non-vectorized**

:star: Here is the [Jupyter Python code](/vectorization.ipynb)

:desktop_computer: _Tested with the hardware below_ :point_down:

| Hardware |                    Specs                    |
|   ---    |                     ---                     |
|   CPU    | _Intel Core i3-12100F (8 CPUs) ~3.3GHz_     |
|   RAM    | _16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3200Mhz_                 |
|   SSD    | _NVMe M.2 SSD (1700MB read / 1600MB write)_ |
