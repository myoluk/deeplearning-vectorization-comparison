# Deep Learning - Vectorized vs Non-vectorized

:star: Here is the [Python code](/vectorization.ipynb)

:astonished: `Vectorized` **394x** faster than `non-vectorized`

:desktop_computer: _Tested with the below hardware_ :point_down:

| Hardware |                    Specs                    |
|   ---    |                     ---                     |
|   CPU    | _Intel Core i3-12100F (8 CPUs), ~3.3GHz_    |
|   RAM    | _16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3200Mhz_                 |
|   SSD    | _NVMe M.2 SSD (1700MB read / 1600MB write)_ |
